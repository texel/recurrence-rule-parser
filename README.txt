= RruleParser

http://www.github.com/texel/recurrence-rule-parser

== DESCRIPTION:

This package takes icalendar events (or any object conforming to their calling conventions),
and handles translating recurrence rules into temporal expressions.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

Current list of supported expressions:
FREQ, INTERVAL, BYDAY, BYMONTHDAY, UNTIL

Many values are still unimplemented.

== SYNOPSIS:

RruleParser should be able to consume any object acting like Icalendar::Event, containing
recurrence rules as specified by the iCalendar (RFC 2445) specification. For more information
on formatting of recurrence rules, visit http://www.kanzaki.com/docs/ical/rrule.html

== EXAMPLES:

  event       = Icalendar::Event.new
  event.start = Time.parse('12/1/2008 3pm')
  event.end   = Time.parse('12/1/2008 6pm')
  
  event.recurrence_rules = ["FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=1;COUNT=10"] 
  
  parser      = RruleParser.new(event)
  date_range  = Date.parse('11/30/2008')..Date.parse('1/1/2009')
  
  parser.dates(date_range)
